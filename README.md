# Exopias Hemligheter
Exopias Hemligheter is a swedish tabletop RPG I design and play with friends.

This is a tool to make it easier to GM the game by generating and managing enemies, generating travelling encounters and generating loot. The program does all this with data downloaded from a google spreadsheet to simplify the iteration process of the design of the game and keep the things in a single location.

It's still a work in progress.
