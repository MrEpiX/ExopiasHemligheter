# Exopias Hemligheter
This project is no longer being worked on, we migrated to DnD 5e where there are more fancy tools available.

~~Exopias Hemligheter is a swedish tabletop RPG I design and play with friends.

~~This is a tool to make it easier to GM the game by generating and managing enemies, generating travelling encounters and generating loot. The program does all this with data downloaded from a google spreadsheet to simplify the iteration process of the design of the game and keep the things in a single location.

~~It's still a work in progress.

~~It uses GDataDB, a database-like interface to Google Spreadsheets for .Net: https://github.com/mausch/GDataDB
